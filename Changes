    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
    - Added 'Changes' log
    - the actual slot, to which the attribute of the class is applied became configurable
      this will allow to have nicer "private" attributes and combined accessors
    - some progress on docs (mentioned custom names for accessors and 'isPrivate' option)
