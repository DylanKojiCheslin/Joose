    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
    - Class/Role/Module in the global scope aliased as Joose.Class/Joose.Role/Joose.Module
    - Joose no longer overwrites the Class/Role/Module symbols in global scope (should allow Prototype support)
    - Static instance ('my') now receives a special 'HOST' configuration parameter during instantiation, containing a hosting class constructor
    - returning 'false' from Joose.A/O.each iterators stops the iteration and can be propagated further 
    - added `Joose.A.map` helper
    - attributes initialization moved from `initialize` method to constructor, this don't break the previous behavior 
        (which was somewhat restrictive - only `after` ) and allows:
            1) the `before` modifier for `initialize` with already initialized attributes
            2) better support for inheriting from non-Joose classes (which may not have `initialize` at all)
    
    
    [BUG FIXES]
    
    - fixed bug, when traits weren't applied to the class with already detached meta 
    (when the meta already had traits)

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
    - Added 'Changes' log
    - the actual slot, to which the attribute of the class is applied became configurable
      this will allow to have nicer "private" attributes and combined accessors
    - some progress on docs (mentioned custom names for accessors and 'isPrivate' option)
