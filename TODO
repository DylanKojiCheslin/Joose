   - Installation 
    -- for Mac OS
    -- verify that procedure works several platforms (CPAN Testers at least) especially on Windows  



CORE FEATURES
=============

- Class as Role? spec&implemented or remove

- 'immutable' builder

- implement optimization for methods/OVERRIDE modifiers w/o SUPER calls ) probably should be configurable, to avoid increasing of startup overhead 

- BUILD method to prepare the arguments passed to constructor

- global 'traits' config? to apply traits immediatly after instance creation?

- some kind of obfuscator to reduce codebase size  


REFACTORING POSSIBILITIES
=========================

- move builderClass and stemClass to private attributes (with leading underscore)?

 -or-

- merge 'builder' into class itself?

- metaclass as subclass of stem?


- refactor addRole (add something like 'beforeAdd' hook, which is very often needs to be overridden)

- convert all OVERRIDE modifiers in core to AROUND? (need to benchmark them 1st)

- merge Containable to something

- cleanClone of Stem move to Composition



EXTENSIONS
==========

- JooseX.Builder.Also (to address Rhino issues and allow multiple modifiers in the same class)

- JooseX.Role.Parameterized

- JooseX.Type

- JooseX.Meta.Configurable (allows builders which will configure the meta + aliases for them)

- JooseX.Attribute:
 - delegation
 - predicating/clearing
 - typing, coercion
 - traits for attributes

- JooseX.Method.Overloaded

DONE
====

- refactor methods & modifiers to reduce overhead
- migrate AUGMENT modifier to closures
- anonymous classes
- refactor helpers
- fix multiple failures under FF3.5
- does for superclasses
- migrate to github
- add override check for PUT modifiers
