<p>Joose.Manual.Traits - Special kind of Roles in Joose.</p>

<h1 id="whatisatrait">WHAT IS A TRAIT?</h1>

<p>In Joose, a trait is almost exactly the same thing as a role, which is composed into an instance of a class at runtime to add or modify the behavior of <em>just that instance</em>. 
Other instances are not affected. </p>

<p>Any role can be used as a trait. There is no special <code>Trait</code> helper or other syntax constructs.</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Logger', {

        requires : [ 'process' ],

        before : {
            process : function () {
                this.log("'process' method was called with the arguments:" + arguments)
            }
        },


        methods : {
            log : function () {
                ...
            }
        }
    })


    Class('Parser', {

        methods : {
            process : function () {
                ...
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="applyingtrait.detaching.">APPLYING TRAIT. DETACHING.</h1>

<p>To apply the trait, you need first to <em>detach</em> the instance from its class, using the standard <code>detach</code> method, which is inherited from <code>Joose.Proto.Object</code></p>

<pre><code>    var parser = new Parser()

    parser.detach()
</code></pre>

<p>After that, the <code>parser</code> instance will have its own instance of metaclass, separated from <code>Person</code>, and you can <em>extend</em> it as usual:</p>

<pre><code>    console.log(parser.meta != Parser.meta) // true, instance was detached

    parser.meta.extend({
        does : Logger
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Now this particular <code>parser</code> instance will perform additional loging during work. Note that any other instances of <code>Parser</code> will not be not affected.</p>

<h1 id="removingtrait.attaching.">REMOVING TRAIT. ATTACHING.</h1>

<p>You may decide to remove the trait (rememeber, all Joose classes are mutable at run-time).</p>

<pre><code>    parser.meta.extend({
        doesnot : Logger
    })
</code></pre>

<p>or just attach an instance back to its class</p>

<pre><code>    parser.attach()
</code></pre>

<p>After attaching any applied traits will be  removed.</p>
